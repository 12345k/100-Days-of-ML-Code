# 100-Days-of-ML-Code - LOG

## Day 0 : July 06 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : I already started to learn ML.Today I learnt Decision Trees and Random Forest. Worked on [Predicting Who Pays Back Loans](https://www.kaggle.com/sarahvch/predicting-who-pays-back-loans)

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way .

## Day 1 : July 07 , 2018

**Today's Progress** :Studied support vector machines(SVM). Worked on [Iris Species](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)

**Thoughts** : Can't understand girdsearch properlly but tried to implement it.

## Day 2 : July 08 , 2018

**Today's Progress** :Studied on K means algorithm.Understand the theory part behind it

**Thoughts** : More confident to work on dataset.

## Day 3 : July 09 , 2018

**Today's Progress** :Worked on K Means Algorithm and applied in a dataset. Worked on [U.S. News and World Reportâ€™s College Data](https://www.kaggle.com/flyingwombat/us-news-and-world-reports-college-data)

**Thoughts** : Understand clustering very well.Tomorrow going to work in PCA

## Day 4 : July 10 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Studied Principal component analysis (PCA). Registred Hackerearth challenge (Predict the damage to a building)

**Thoughts** : Understand the use of PCA.Tomorrow going to start NLP basic project (spam or not mail)

## Day 5 : July 11 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Studied NLP. Expolred the dataset and done some basic dataset analysis. 

**Thoughts** : Try to figure out which algorithm is best. 


## Day 6 : July 12 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Worked on [SpaceX Launch Data](https://www.kaggle.com/scoleman/spacex-launch-data)

**Thoughts** : This is a small dataset.So i just decided to understand the importance of data visualization. Without using the data visualization I tried to find insights in dataset.Hopefully I found two insights

## Day 7 : July 13 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Studied the basice of tensorflow.

**Thoughts** : Hope will explore a lot in that.

## Day 8 : July 16 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Worked on MNIST Dataset

**Thoughts** : Want to understand more

## Day 9 : July 17 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Worked on [Bank notes](https://www.kaggle.com/aariyan101/bank-notes).Used tensorflow DNN Classifier

**Thoughts** : Way to go in deep learning.

**Thoughts** : New hights to go.

## Day 12 : July 19 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : How to do optimization?

**Thoughts** : clearly I have no idea how to do optimization

## Day 13 : July 20 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learnt Genectic Algorithm

**Thoughts** : How to apply in Finanace dataset.

## Day 14 : July 21 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : QuantConnect platform.Tried to do backtesting on it.

**Thoughts** : Its is very challenging to do optimization.

## Day 15 : July 22 , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learnt basics of Neural Network.

**Thoughts** : Cant understand the Label Encoder and one-Hot Encoder.
